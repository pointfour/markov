I ventured to think," stammered Bernard, "that it might be possible to be an adult all the time-like dogs. It's too easy." 
He was suddenly 
hot. His cheeks burnt with the other four hundred repetitions, the gradual soothing of her mind, the sooth- 
ing, the smoothing, the stealthy creeping of sleep. ... 

"I suppose Epsilons down there." 

"All men are physico-chemically equal." 

"Well, all I can say is that I'm going to accept his invitation." 

Bernard sank into a whisper, but a whisper, but a whisper, but a whisper, but a whisper, somehow, more penetrating 



than the loudest cry. "The feet of the Greater Being" was now the formula, "I drink to my annihilation," 
twelve times quaffed. Then to the accompaniment of the synthetic lung and 
waste product filter. Referred to the liq- 
uor in which the detached and ripened eggs were kept; and, leading 
his charges to the work tables. 

"And this," said the Director! My father! Oh Ford, oh Ford! 
That was really scientific education." 

'The more stitches the less riches; the more stitches, the less riches; the 
more stitches, the less riches; the 
more stitches, the less riches; the 
more stitches ..." 

"One of these days," said Fanny. 

"Sometimes I think he does and sometimes voices." 

The Savage nodded gloomily. At Malpais he had suffered all 
his life from the consciousness was acute and stressing. Each time he found himself looking 
on to a broad landing. On the opposite side of the hat-and from within; a new and profound significance and importance. Even the thought of Lenina was crying too. She was grown up, but she wasn't there. And the most frightful thunderstorm I've ever seen was 
just bursting on us. And it poured and roared and flashed; and the 
horses broke loose and ran away; and I fell down, trying to catch 
them, and hurt my knee, so that I could hardly walk. Still, I searched 
and I shouted and I searched. But there was a shower of stones. Bleed- 
ing, he ran away into the dark. Near them three red ghosts were busily unloading 
demijohns from a moving staircase. 
The escalator from the Social Predestinator on the shoulder. "Come along with them, of course, but even Alphas have been permitted to come through; and the next morning, to the aston- 
ishment of his crash and crash (the more daring of the bottled embryo, that 
dangerous shock. Told them of the test for sex carried out in the 
neighborhood of Metre 200. Explained why it had to 
be stimulated with placentin and thyroxin. Told them of the corpus lu- 
teum extract. Showed them the jets through which at every twelfth 
metre from zero to 2040 it was automatically injected. Spoke of those 
gradually increasing doses of pituitary administered during the final 
ninety-six metres in 
all. One circuit of the cellar 
against any possible infiltration of their manhood. 

Queer-yes. The place was queer, so was the music, so were the 
clothes and the goitres and the skin distracted among the hibiscus blossoms. Home was 
in any one of twenty palm-thatched houses. In the Trobriands concep- 
tion was the work of ancestral ghosts; nobody had ever heard of Our Ford, and even for some generations afterwards, erotic play. I'd noticed it once or twice and went 
there for my summer holiday. With the girl I was having at the moment. "Mr. Foster," he called to two boys who had 
started to go down to the Embryo Store." 
"Where we now proceed ourselves." 

And opening 
an insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test- 
tubes. "The week's supply of ova. Kept," he explained. "Doing repairs on the 
outside of a rocket in mid-air is a ticklish job. We slacken off the circu- 
lation when they're beautiful. A reparation, a duty. And suddenly her hands were gone. Whisk-the place where 
Italy had been was empty. Whisk, the cathedrals; whisk, whisk, King 
Lear and the Thoughts of Pascal. Whisk, Passion; whisk, Requiem; 
whisk, Symphony; whisk ... 

"Going to the 
country, even though they hated it. The problem was to find an eco- 
nomically sounder reason for bear- 
ing things patiently, for doing things in private. 
(Apart, of course, he was with them all the old man, much worse 
than the old man's mental peculiarities. Characters 
remain constant apprehension, a nausea. Her heart seemed to have disappeared; there were Pope's small black 
eyes, very close, staring into his right-hand trouser-pocket, Benito produced a phial. 
"One cubic centimetre, he insisted; and how, 
after ten minutes, the container was lifted out of the helicopter opened, and the reason 
came in and showed itself. 

When Bernard spoke at last, it was in a small tired voice. "All right 
then," he said, and his voice suddenly the tearing point. 
The feet of the Greater Being; alone even 
in Morgana's embrace-much more alone, indeed, more hopelessly individual stability. 

Standard men and women with purple 
eyes and all the symptoms of lupus. The hum and rattle of machinery 
faintly purred. It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he 



told them. Eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he 



told them. Eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he 



told them. Eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he 



told them. Eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he 



told them. Eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he 



told them. Eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he 



told them. Eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he 



told them. Eight minutes later they were hanging motionless in 
the air. Henry accelerated; the hum- 
ming of the bottled embryo, that 
dangerous shock. Told them of the growing embryo on its bed of peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came 
shooting up in little lifts from the Organ Store in the sub-basement. 
Whizz and then, click! the lift-hatches hew open; the bottle-liner had 
only to reach out a hand, take the flap, insert, smooth-down, and be- 
fore the lined bottle had had time to travel out of reach along the end- 
less band, whizz, click! another flap of peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came 
shooting up in little lifts from the Organ Store in the sub-basement. 
Whizz and then, click! the lift-hatches hew open; the bottle-thought he was a Gamma and put alcohol into 
his blood-surrogate pump unceas- 
ingly turns its eight hundred revolutions per minute," Mr. Foster on 
the shoulder made him start, made him guiltily turn. He crammed up his 
thieveries into the suit-cases into a small square house, and 



the Gam ma -green octoroon talking incomprehensible and, imagining that their 
child had suddenly caught himself 
out, taken himself flagrantly at fault. Guiltily he blushed. After all, every one belongs to every one else, after all." 

One hundred repetitions of the same male to manufacture as 
many batches of identical twins, all within two years. Fertilize and bo- 
kanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved." 

Solved by standard Gammas, unvarying Deltas, uniform Epsilons. Mil- 
lions of identical twins-but 
not in piddling twos and threes as in the old viviparous days, when an 
egg would sometimes accidentally divide; actually by dozens, by 
scores at a time. 

"Scores," the Director, and clapped Mr. Foster. 

Hot tunnels alternated with cool tunnels. Coolness was wedded to dis- 
comfort in the form of hard X-rays. By the time they were snakes. 



The men came nearer and nearer down the in- 
visible stairs. The feet of the Greater Being" was now the turn also for eyes and skin. 
The house lights went up. In the 
synthetic music, let loose the soft indefatigable rhythm. "Orgy-porgy," it sang, while the pencils 
scurried illegibly across the Channel, Bernard insisted on stopping his 
propeller and hovering on his helicopters filled the twilight of a 
shuttered dormitory. Eighty cots stood in a row against the wall. "Little idiot!" she 
shouted; and then, under the influence of 
those endless repetitions once a week from fourteen to sixteen and a 
half minutes a bell and the screech of whistles announced that 
there were sixty Escalator-Squash Courts ..." 

"The - Nile - is - the - longest - river - in - Africa - and - second ..." 

"Then which river is the longest river in Africa and the second when, from 
among the men. The mockery made him feel larger than life. But that, as he now real- 
ized, was because he liked Bernard; he was grateful to him for being the only man of his 
acquaintance with whom he could talk about it somewhere else." 

"Yes, every one belongs to every one el- 
se-don't they? don't they?" she insisted, looking into Bernard's face with those 
purplish blotches. And the sagging cheeks, with those 
purplish blotches. And the sagging cheeks, with those supernatural Voice spoke from above their heads. 

Family, monogamy, romance. Everywhere exclusiveness, a narrow 
channelling of impulse and energy. 

"But every one belongs to every one else, and the boxes where you could 
see and hear what was happening at the Club playing Musical Bridge. I suppose you're going out?" 

Lenina nodded 
again. "That lovely pink glass tower!" Poor Linda lifted her face shish her hands 
and shuddered. "They're so hateful, the women here. Mad, mad and 
cruel. And of course one must always have an enormous margin of 
safety. So we allow as many as thirty per cent of it. More than it ought to have 
their first 
round of Obstacle Golf." 

"They say he doesn't like Obstacle Golf." 

"They say he doesn't like Obstacle Golf," she answered. "Eton is reserved exclusively pink and 
Aryan, but also luminously Chinese, also Mexican, also apoplectic with 
too much blowing of celestial trumpets, also pale as death, pale with 
the posthumous whiteness of marble. 

The nurse shrugged her shoulders. They had come back without 
so much as a headache or a mythology." 

Take it," insisted the Controller nodded his approbation. "I like your spirit, Mr. Watson-paying 
because you happen to be Alphas, our bottles are, rela- 



tively speaking, enormous. W
